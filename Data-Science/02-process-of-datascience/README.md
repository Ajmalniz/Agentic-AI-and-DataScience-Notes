# Stages of Data Science Process
The video explains that data science is a step-by-step process to solve problems using data. The main stages are:

1. **Problem Formulation**: Figure out what question or problem you want to solve.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Get the data you need to answer the question.
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and organize the data so it’s ready to use.
4. **Data Analysis**: Study the data to find patterns or answers.
5. **Communication and Visualization**: Share the results in a clear way, often with charts or pictures.

# Problem Formulation
- This is the first step.
- You need to ask: “What problem are we trying to solve?”
- Example: A company might want to know why customers stop buying their product.
- It’s about making the question clear and specific so you know what to focus on.

# Data Acquisition
- This means collecting the data you need.
- Data can come from many places, like surveys, websites, or company records.
- Example: If you’re studying customer behavior, you might get data from sales reports or online reviews.
- The goal is to gather enough good data to work with.

# Data Preparation
- Data is often messy, so you have to fix it.
- This step includes cleaning (removing errors), organizing, and formatting the data.
- Example: If some numbers are missing or there are typos, you correct them.
- It makes the data easier to analyze later.

# Data Analysis
- This is where you study the data to find answers.
- You use tools like math, statistics, or computer programs to look for patterns.
- Example: You might find that customers leave because of high prices.
- It’s about digging into the data to solve the problem.

# Communication and Visualization
- After analysis, you share what you found.
- Use simple words, charts, or graphs to explain it to others.
- Example: Show a graph of sales dropping when prices go up.
- The goal is to make the results easy to understand for everyone, not just data experts.

# Summary
The video shows that data science is like a recipe: you start with a question, get your ingredients (data), prepare them, cook (analyze), and then serve it nicely (communicate). Each step builds on the last one to solve the problem.
