# Data Science Notes Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my personal Data Science Notes Repository! This repository is created and maintained by me, **Ajmal Khan**, to store and organize my notes, code, and resources related to Data Science. All the content here, including code snippets and study notes, is shared by me as I progress through my learning journey.

This repository is **not an official repository** affiliated with any organization or institution. It is simply a personal project designed to document my studies and, hopefully, help others who are interested in Data Science.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Keep a record of my Data Science learning process.
- Share useful code, notes, and insights with the community.
- Serve as a resource for anyone looking to explore Data Science concepts.

## Connection to Awfera LMS
I’d like to extend a special thanks to **Awfera LMS** ([https://www.awferalms.com/](https://www.awferalms.com/)), an incredible online education platform that empowers underprivileged youth in Pakistan with skills in AI and modern technologies. Their interactive programs and focus on accessible learning have inspired me to pursue and document my studies in Data Science. While this repository is not officially linked to Awfera LMS, their mission to upskill learners has motivated me to contribute to the community in my own way.
