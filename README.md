# Data Science & Agentic AI Learning Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my personal learning repository! This repository is created and maintained by me, **Ajmal Khan**, to document and organize my learning journey in Data Science and Agentic AI. All content here, including code snippets, study notes, and resources, is shared as I progress through my learning path.

This repository is **not an official repository** affiliated with any organization or institution. It is a personal project designed to document my studies and share knowledge with the community.

## Learning Paths

### 1. Data Science
The primary goal of this section is to:
- Keep a record of my Data Science learning process
- Share useful code, notes, and insights with the community
- Serve as a resource for anyone looking to explore Data Science concepts

#### Resources
- **Awfera LMS** ([https://www.awferalms.com/](https://www.awferalms.com/)) - An incredible online education platform that empowers underprivileged youth in Pakistan with skills in AI and modern technologies.

### 2. Agentic AI
I'm currently learning Agentic AI through the following resources:
- **Learn Agentic AI** ([https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai)) - A comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Agentic AI systems.
